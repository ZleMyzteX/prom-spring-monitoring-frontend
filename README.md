# PromSpringMonitoringFrontend

A very basic frontend app, connects to the [backend part](https://github.com/ZleMyzteX/prometheus-springboot-monitoring).

Uses the localhost:8080 port to connect to the backend part. 

Used to test connectivity to backend and simulate data for the backend part of the application. Also, this is used as a docker image in the k8s setup.
